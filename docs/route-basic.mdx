# Route basic

Route is the wrapper of the destination/route we attach with the every composable page.
Every route has its own arguments and deep links. Route wraps everything.
To create a Route use its constructor data class `Route(name: String, ...)`

Create a simple Route with just its name:
```kotlin
val splash = Route("splash")
```

* Whenevery you need the route name(string) just use `.name`.
* When you need to navigate to a route use `.full`.
