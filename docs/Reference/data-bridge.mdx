# Data Bridge

## Access variable

There are various methods to get various type of variables

```kt
fun rememberFloatState(id: Any): State<Float>
fun rememberDoubleState(id: Any): State<Double>
fun rememberStringState(id: Any): State<String>
fun rememberStringResourceState(id: Any): State<StringResource>
fun rememberBoolState(id: Any): State<Boolean>
fun rememberSafeBoolState(id: Any): State<Boolean>?
fun rememberIntState(id: Any): State<Int>
fun <T> rememberListState(id: Any): SnapshotStateList<T>
fun <T> rememberSafeListState(id: Any): SnapshotStateList<T>?
fun <T, E> rememberMapState(id: Any): SnapshotStateMap<T, E>
fun <T, E> rememberSafeMapState(id: Any): SnapshotStateMap<T, E>?
fun <T> rememberT(id: Any): T
fun <T> rememberTState(id: Any): State<T>
fun <T> rememberSafeTState(id: Any): State<T>?
```

## Access scope

You can access variable from any composable scope as long as it is inside(direct/deep) `MyScreen`.
You can access from parameter/argument section or in function block section.

```kt
@Composable
fun MyComposableUi(
    name: State<String> = rememberStringState(id = MyDataIds.Name )
){
    val phone = rememberStringState(id = MyDataIds.Phone)
}
```

## Data must be mapped

If a variable accessed but not mapped then the app will crash for sure.

## Data mapping

Use `controller.resolver.addAll` method to map data with `id`.

```kt
controller.resolver.addAll(
    id to version,
    ...
)
```

Mapping should be done on `init` normally.

The rule of thumb is to map the data before accessing it.

## Data type

Variable must be accessed with exact data type it is declared with otherwise app will crash for sure.
