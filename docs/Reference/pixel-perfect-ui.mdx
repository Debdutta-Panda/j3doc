# Pixel Perfect UI

## dep & sep

J3 has a nice way to have Pixel Perfect ui in all devices.

Just use `dep` instead of **dp** and `sep` insted of **sp**.

But fot that wrap all your ui with the design width in figma or xd.

```kt
CompositionLocalProvider(localDesignWidth provides  360f) {
    AllYourUi()
}
```

## depx

```kt
20.depx is equivalent to 20.dp.value * density
// means number of pixels covered by 20.dp
// it is useful in graphics programming in canvas
```

## sepx

Similar to `depx`
